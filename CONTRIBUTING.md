# Oz RBAC Controller - Contribution Guide

# Welcome to GitHub docs contributing guide <!-- omit in toc -->

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project!

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from
opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## New contributor guide

To get an overview of the project, read the [README](README.md). Here are some
resources to help you get started with open source contributions:

## Getting started

To get started with developing this codebase, see the [development
guide](./DEVELOPMENT.md) :confetti_bell:.

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with the docs, [search if an issue already
exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments).
If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant
[issue form](https://github.com/diranged/oz/issues/new/choose).

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/diranged/oz/issues) to
find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as
filters. See [Labels](/contributing/how-to-use-labels.md) for more information.
As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to
work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Make Changes

1. Fork the Repo ([here](https://github.com/diranged/oz/fork))

2. Check out a development branch: `git checkout -b my_feature`

3. Create your changes, test them locally. See
   [DEVELOPMENT.md](./DEVELOPMENT.md) for the process.

### Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them. Don't forget to
[self-review](/contributing/self-review.md) to speed up the review
process:zap:.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This
  template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of
  your pull request.

- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue)
  if you are solving one.

- Enable the checkbox to
  [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork)
  so the branch can be updated for a merge.

Once you submit your PR, a Docs team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.

- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using
  [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request)
  or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through
  the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your
  branch.

- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as
  [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).

- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git
  tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you
  resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

### Your PR is merged!

Congratulations :tada::tada:
